wizirt 0.0.0.0
==============

## Package Overview

The wizirt package (currently named wizirt2) is up and running, it seems
to work for different data sets. It has a limited functionality, but it
is currently working.

The wizirt package represents the work of my dissertation. As such I
have agreed to do the following for my dissertation:

  - Provide general model information including:
      - Model call
      - Description of model run
      - Software and version
      - Estimator
      - Convergence status, criteria, values
      - Estimation issues
      - Response data described (sample size, demographics)
      - Descriptions of items and test
      - Missing data summary
      - Description of missing data handling
  - Provide model fit information
      - Unidimensionality (DETECT)
      - Absolute fit
      - Relative fit
      - Anova method for comparing models
  - Provide item information
      - Parameter estimates
      - Summary statistics
  - Provide item-fit information
      - Conditional dependence
      - Functional form (isn’t this model-data fit?)
      - Fit statistics
      - predicted vs observed item response functions
      - misfitting items flagged
  - Provide person information
      - Person location estimates (including SE)
  - Provide person-fit information
      - Global detection (Ht, lz\*, infit and outfit, with cutoffs where
        applicable)
      - Local detection (ICI or other)
      - Tabulation or presentation of response patterns (winsteps tables
        as guides)
      - PRF (nonparametric, parametric may follow later)
      - MLM (Reise, Conijn)
  - Two levels of accessibility
      - Comprehensive report for beginners
      - Felxible functions for advanced users
  - Learning Resources
      - Github website
      - CRAN-style reference page
      - tidyverse-style cheat sheet
      - Karabatsos’s simulation replication article
  - Quality Assurance
      - Accuracy check
          - Match IRTPRO, Winsteps
          - Replicate Karabatsos
      - Informative check (meet all the checks above two levels…)
      - Usefulness check
          - Usability testing
          - Call it from python on separate laptop
      - Aesthetics check
          - Repetition
          - Contrast
          - Alignment
          - Proximity

My goal is to complete all of this by October 24. That will give me a
week to write it all up by October 30 and give it to my chair. Then I
will have a week to improve it according to my chair’s recommendations
so I can send it to my committee by November 6.
